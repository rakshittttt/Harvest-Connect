You are a senior frontend engineer and UI/UX designer. Build a responsive, production-quality frontend website for an agriculture platform aimed at Indian farmers. The design inspiration must be very similar in look and feel to https://www.andhuman.co/
 — minimal, modern, calm, human-centric, with generous whitespace, soft typography, rounded components, subtle hover animations, and a clean visual hierarchy. The website should feel trustworthy, inclusive, and easy to use for first-time users.

Create a dashboard-style layout that loads after login (authentication not required for now). At the top of the website, implement a sticky horizontal navigation bar with the following items in this exact order: “Communities Around You”, “Latest Laws and Articles”, “Offline Helpline Systems”, and “Current MSPs”. These sections should be visually present in the UI, but only the Dashboard and Communities feature must be fully functional at this stage.

The dashboard should welcome the user with a message such as “Welcome, Farmer from [State]” and a short subtitle encouraging engagement. The primary working feature must be “Communities Around You”. In this section, allow the user to enter their location (state, district, or area) in an input field and click a “Find Communities” button. Based on the entered location, display relevant communities using mock/static data in a modern card-based layout. Each community card should include a community name, location, short description, and a “Join Community” button. When the user clicks “Join Community”, the button should change state to “Joined”, show a confirmation message, and the community should appear under a separate “Your Communities” section on the dashboard.

Use React with Tailwind CSS (or Next.js if more appropriate). Do not implement backend logic, authentication, MSP logic, translation, or IVR functionality yet — only frontend behavior using mock data. Ensure the layout is fully responsive for mobile and desktop, with smooth transitions and hover effects inspired by andhuman.co. Structure the code cleanly with reusable components such as Navbar, Dashboard, CommunityCard, and CommunityList. The final output should be complete frontend code with a clear folder structure and well-commented components.
